# gurps-inventory-weapon-aid
this offers a option to track your bullets and ammunition in gurps with a little bit of flair

The plan is to build a GUI enviroment to more easly track ammunition in GURPS, and also, to create a fun way to weapon management.
whenever you shoot a gun, it automatically discards a bullet from the magazine and play the designated song to all players in the party, creating a more immersive expercience in
combat
